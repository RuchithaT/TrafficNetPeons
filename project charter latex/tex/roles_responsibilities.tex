The only responsibilities each team member has had so far is to finish the project charter tasks that were assigned to each team member. Since the project is at the early stages of development the team does not have concrete roles for each team member. Although some team members like Peyton and Kyle have taken the time to setup the Raspberry Pi which the team will need to begin testing. Once the team has the necessary materials and has everything setup to begin building the project, the team will begin assigning roles to each team member.
