Most of our testing will be done at UTA, where we have access to different type of tools. Some of the equipment that we will use for the project are a Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi camera, infrared camera, some type of surface mount which the team is still unsure of, Axis 214, stepper motors, solar panels, and battery. NOTE â€“ some of the equipment might change since the project is in the early stages of development.
