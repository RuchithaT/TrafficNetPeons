TrafficNetPeonsâ„¢ is a subsidiary of TrafficNet and therefore adheres to the mission of our parent company amenably. Within the realm of previously etablished designs, TNP has been born from a singular ambition. Our vision is to create an affordable, low power, weatherproof camera most suitable for use in the traffic monitoring industry. We share this vision with TrafficNet, and to produce anything beyond the boundaries of this vision violates our responsibilities to them.
