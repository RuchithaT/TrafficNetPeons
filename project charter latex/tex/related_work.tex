The closest solution that exist would be the Axis 214. The Axis 214 was used but then was discontinued because it did not have the necessary software and hardware. One example would be that TrafficNet wanted the camera to have heating capabilities when bad weather was an issue, which the Axis 214 did not have. Another requirement that TrafficNet wanted was the camera to have a pan and tilt, which the Axis 214 also did not have. As stated before, even though the Axis 214 was discontinued it would serve as the closest solution so our team can build upon it. \cite{Rubin2012}.
